    "text": "Perfect, thanks for the clarification! Here's an updated version that accurately reflects the student-led and self-organized nature of the Freshers’ Party at IIIT Nagpur:\nAt IIIT Nagpur, theFreshers' Partyis a unique, unofficial student-organized event that celebrates the beginning of college life for the first-year batch. Unlike traditional setups in many institutions, the freshers at IIIT Nagpur take complete charge of organizing their own welcome party—right from planning to execution.\nThe event is entirely planned and hosted by first-year students themselves. A dedicated team is formed within the batch—often from theOC (Organizing Committee)—to handle everything from budgeting, collecting entry fees, selecting a venue, managing logistics, and curating the event experience.\nAlthough unofficial and independent of the institute’s formal calendar, the Freshers’ Party plays a key role in fostering early friendships, creating unforgettable memories, and promoting team spirit and event management experience among first-year students.",
